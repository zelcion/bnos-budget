# UI Specs

## Navigation Bar
- Sits at the bottom of the screen
- Big Number On Screen (home) icon in the center, preselected when opening the app

## Summary/Progress Bar
Goal is to show how much of the budget is left for the month, and how much has been spent. This will be a horizontal bar that fills up as you spend money, with the big number above it showing the exact amount available.

It should sit inside the navigation bar container, above the buttons, with a small margin.

It should be multi segmented to have:
- empty (available budget)
- red (Spent money)
- light orange (planned expenses)
- light green (savings goals)

It should have a border that's color coded to match the big number (green, yellow, red, purple, dark purple) to give a quick visual cue of how you're doing.

## Home Screen
Big number and icons for quick expense entry must be the main focus.

- Expense list should be just slightly off screen, nudging the user to scroll down and see it, but still retaining the focus on the big number and quick entry buttons.
- Scrolling down to the expense list should cause the big number and quick entry buttons to shrink and stick to the top of the screen, so that they are still visible while browsing past expenses, but not taking up too much space.

## Project Overview

## Future Integrations

- OpenFinance (Brazilian financial data API) for automatic transaction fetching
- Multi-currency support with exchange rates

- Static asset tracking (property, stocks, Bitcoin)

## Development Status

Project is in planning stage. No code implementation yet.
